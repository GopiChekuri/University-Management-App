# University Management System

A web application for managing student, department, instructor, and advisor records. This app allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various entities in a university database. It is built using React for the frontend and interacts with a backend server (Node.js) to manage the data.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Insert, update, delete, and search records in the database.
- **Table Management**: Select between different tables (Student, Department, Instructor, Advisor).
- **Dynamic Form**: The input form adjusts based on the selected table and allows the addition or modification of records.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL (Assumed to be connected via API)
- **API Requests**: Axios for interacting with the backend
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with a blue theme for a clean and modern interface
